# Security and Privacy Policy

## Privacy-First Principle
NUNCHI is built on the principle of minimal data retention. The service is designed to provide coaching insights without permanent storage of sensitive conversational data.

## Zero-Retention Protocol
The Zero-Retention Protocol ensures that:
- Raw audio files are stored in volatile memory or temporary encrypted storage during processing.
- All raw data is permanently deleted immediately upon completion of the analysis or confirmation by the user.
- No conversational data is used for model training without explicit, verifiable user opt-in.

## Data Encryption
- In Transit: All data transmitted between the client and the server is encrypted using TLS 1.3 or higher.
- At Rest: Any temporary data stored in our system is encrypted using AES-256.

## Infrastructure Security
Our infrastructure is managed through automated orchestration scripts (IaC) to ensure consistent security configurations and minimize manual error. Access to production environments is strictly limited to authorized personnel via multi-factor authentication.

## Vulnerability Disclosure
If you discover a potential security vulnerability in our platform, please report it through our official security channel. We operate a coordinated disclosure program to address and resolve security issues promptly.
